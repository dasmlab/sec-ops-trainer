# SecOps Standards Officer - Learning Roadmap

## Overall Learning Path

This roadmap provides a high-level view of the competency development journey from foundation to SecOps Standards Officer.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the Foundation Tier, candidates should have:
- Basic understanding of IT systems and networking
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Interest in security and risk management
- 2-3 years of hands-on IT experience (recommended but not required)

## Tier Progression

```
Foundation Tier
    ↓
Intermediate Tier

Expert Tier (SecOps Standards Officer)
```

### Estimated Timeline

- **Foundation Tier**: 6-12 months
- **Intermediate Tier**: 12-18 months
- **Advanced Tier**: 18-24 months
- **Expert Tier**: Ongoing (continuous learning)

*Note: Timeline varies based on prior experience, available time, and chosen specializations.*

## Core Competency Areas by Tier

### Foundation Tier
Focus: Build fundamental knowledge and skills
- Linux/Open Systems basics
- Network fundamentals (OSI Layers 3, 4, 7)
- Basic security concepts
- Introduction to compliance frameworks

### Intermediate Tier
Focus: Hands-on security implementation
- Advanced Linux administration (RHEL)
- Network security implementations
- Security tooling and automation
- Compliance implementation (basic)
- Introduction to standards bodies

### Advanced Tier
Focus: Policy development and risk frameworks
- Strategic security policy development
- Risk management frameworks
- Standards body deep-dives
- Virtualization and container security
- Identity and access management
- Infrastructure at scale

### Expert Tier
Focus: Standards setting and strategic leadership
- Security vision and posture definition
- Cross-team influence and collaboration
- Advanced risk management
- Standards governance
- Continuous evolution of security posture

## Branchable Learning Paths

After completing Foundation Tier, candidates can emphasize:

1. **Infrastructure-Focused Path**
   - Deep dive into hardware, platforms, networking
   - Focus on IaaS, CaaS deployments
   - Infrastructure risk management

2. **Application-Focused Path**
   - Emphasis on PaaS, containerization
   - SecDevOps integration
   - Application security standards

3. **Compliance-Focused Path**
   - Deep expertise in specific standards (NIST, ISO, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Audit and assessment methodologies
   - Regulatory compliance frameworks

4. **Identity & Access Path**
   - Specialization in IAM technologies
   - Authentication/authorization frameworks
   - Zero-trust architectures

## RHEL Certification Path (Recommended)

Red Hat certifications should be pursued throughout the tiers:

1. **Foundation Tier**: RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator)
2. **Intermediate Tier**: RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer) or RHCSE (Red Hat Certified Specialist)
3. **Advanced Tier**: RHCA (Red Hat Certified Architect) - Security specialization
4. **Expert Tier**: Maintain certifications, pursue advanced specializations

## Cross-Domain Integration

Throughout all tiers, ensure:
- **OSI Layers**: Build understanding progressively (L3 → L4 → L5 → L7)
- **Standards Bodies**: Introduction → Implementation → Governance
- **Practical Experience**: Balance theoretical learning with hands-on practice
- **Linux Foundation**: RHEL knowledge strengthens all other domains

# Hardware & Infrastructure at Scale Domain

## Overview

This domain covers chip-level security, platform security, hardware security, and infrastructure at scale from a risk management perspective. A SecOps Standards Officer must understand infrastructure choices at scale and their security implications for making strategic decisions.

## Priority: **MEDIUM-HIGH** ⭐

Understanding hardware, platform, and infrastructure security at scale is essential for risk management, vendor selection, and strategic technology decisions.

# Networking & Routing Domain

## Overview

Networking and routing expertise is fundamental for a SecOps Standards Officer. This domain covers WAN/LAN architectures, routing protocols, network security, and Cisco certification paths. Historically, Cisco certifications (especially CCNA and CCNP) have been the industry standard for networking expertise.

## Priority: **HIGH** ⭐⭐

Strong networking knowledge is essential for understanding network security architecture, designing secure network policies, and assessing infrastructure security risks.
